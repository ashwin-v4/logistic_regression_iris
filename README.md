This is a simple model that uses logistic regression on iris dataset. Iris dataset is a popularly used dataset in ML. Each sample contains,
0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica 
as its target.
My model predicts or classifies all the samples that are Virginica.
sepal length (cm)	sepal width (cm)	petal length (cm)	petal width (cm)
Virginica is the desired output/Target.
